## /src/notebooks

<br />

This folder contains all the research and development from my time in the internship (~the first four weeks). The week prefix of each file only indicates the week I first started working on that notebook; I went back to several notebooks frequently over multiple weeks, either to revisit key ideas or to refine the code. A summary of the work I did in these first four weeks can be found in `Internship Summary`.
