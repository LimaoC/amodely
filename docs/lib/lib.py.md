## lib.py

This file contains constants necessary for the model and dashboard to function.

---

### Data constants

These are constants related to the dataframe itself (e.g. data headings), and should only be changed if the data format itself changes.

### Plotly Dashboard constants

These are constants used in the Plotly Dashboard, and can be freely changed if needed.
